Potluck allows users to input ingredients that they have in the house and find recipes
that include them. The interface is very straightforward, but since you have to have
at least half of the ingredients in a recipe in order to be matched with it, and since
there are only so many recipes in the app right now, we wanted to provide you with a
few options that will definitely bring up matches:

cheese, chicken
egg, flour, yeast
rice, shrimp

You can of course try any other list you want -- some will have matches and some won't
-- but these three options are just so you can guarantee a match if you want to.

Thanks, and we hope you enjoy using the app!
